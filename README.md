# KC Detection Algorithm

K Complex detection algorithm based on Machine Learning Techniques for NREM-Stage 2 of sleep.

This algorithm is the continuation of the repository called "[KCdetector-S2NREM](https://github.com/aylinavch/KCdetector-S2NREM)" which was used for my Final Project to graduate in Bioengineering at Buenos Aires Institute of Technology.
