# KC Detection Algorithm

K Complex detection algorithm based on Machine Learning Techniques for NREM-Stage 2 of sleep.

This algorithm is the continuation of the repository called "[KCdetector-S2NREM](https://github.com/aylinavch/KCdetector-S2NREM)" which was used for my Final Project to graduate in Bioengineering at Buenos Aires Institute of Technology.

## Set up 💻

You must need python 3.9 installed in your computer. Also you will need to create python environments  (`python-venv`).

Once you have both things, you must run in a terminal inside the directory of this project:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

If you have macOS or Linux:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
```

If you have Windows:

```
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install requirements.txt
```

Once everything was installed, now you can run this program. 

> ⚠️ Everytime you will want to run this program again, you must activate the virtual environment. You can do it writing inside the console `source .venv/bin/activate` in Linux or MacOS, or running `source .venv/Scripts/activate` in Windows.
